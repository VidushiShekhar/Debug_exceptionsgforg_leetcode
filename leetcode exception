 encountered Wrong Answer/Runtime Error for a specific test case.
 When I test my code using this test case, it produced the correct output. Why?

First, please check if you are using any global or static variables.
 They are Evil, period. If you must declare one, reset them in the first line
 of your called method or in the default constructor.

Why? Because the system executes all test cases using the same program instance,
 global/static variables affect the program state from one test case to another.
 See this Discuss thread for an example.

The same problem was encountered in Geeks for geeks solution submission.
The screenshot is Attached with  the solution of how to debug the problem
